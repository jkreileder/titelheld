# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

Notable changes, newest first. Versions are [SemVer](https://semver.org/); the project is
pre-1.0, so the minor number moves for anything that would otherwise be a major bump.

Releases are cut by hand from a signed tag — see
[Cutting a release](README.md#cutting-a-release). The release workflow refuses to run while the
section for the tag being released still says *Unreleased*, so dating this file is a required
step rather than a habit.

## [v0.1.0] – 2026-08-20

First release. The service is deployable but does not yet name anything: it classifies, stores
and describes, and `DRY_RUN` is on, so it cannot write to Strava.

- **Classifier.** Five tiers — skip, virtual, commute, errand and sport ride — assigned from
  sport type, distance, duration and geofences. The tier is decided independently of the current
  title; a separate gate then refuses to act on any activity another tool has already named.
- **Strava client and OAuth.** Authorization-code bootstrap and a token source that survives the
  rotating refresh token. Writes are refused twice over: once in `UpdateActivityName` and again
  in the transport, which will not issue a non-`GET` request unless writes are explicitly on.
- **Webhook.** Subscription validation handshake and event intake, acknowledged immediately and
  persisted out of band so Strava's timeout is never the thing that decides what is stored.
- **Persistence.** Firestore-backed token, queue, named-activity and geocode-cache stores, plus
  an in-memory implementation. Both are held to one conformance suite.
- **Geography.** Polyline decoding and Nominatim reverse geocoding, rate-limited and cached. The
  naming layer receives verified place names only, and there is nowhere in the result type to put
  a coordinate.
- **Infrastructure.** Terraform for the whole GCP footprint: Firestore, Cloud Run, Workload
  Identity Federation, Secret Manager secret resources, the sweep schedule and a budget alert.
- **Release automation.** A signed tag builds the image once, attests it with SLSA provenance,
  and deploys that digest to Cloud Run.
